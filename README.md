## An Adjustment for My Own Workflow

As someone who is intimately familiar with Trello, I figured I'd take the opportunity for this quick assignment to look up some other Trello workflows people have used in the past for complex projects. This article introduces how an app, Robust Symfony 4, came to be with the help of Trello outlining each stage of development. At the start the boards were pretty standard, but a unique part of this article is that they added roles, in a sense, to the board which reminded me of Scrum roles.

The team using this Trello board came up with a new set of workflow rules, which can be found on [the article above](https://polcode.com/blog/trello-in-software-development-how-to-manage-complex-projects/). The fascinating thing here is that they appear to have assigned people roles, for example a **Trello Janitor**. This person is responsible for keeping the board clean and assigning members (perhaps versus them assigning it themselves).

In the past, I've expanded quite a bit on the standard task board setup for my own projects, and have used it for community issue tracking. This idea of user roles strikes me as one to try out with a few other people I work with so that we have a more niche part of the board to manage as opposed to tracking our own cards.


## Comment - Ashley Nussbaum

I've never used Trello before, but I've used Jira for a couple of projects. My team, however followed a very basic workflow; it would be interesting to try to incorporate some of the concepts mentioned in the article.
